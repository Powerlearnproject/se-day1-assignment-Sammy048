Software Engineering Day 1 Assignment

Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Definition & Importance
   Software engineering is the systematic process of developing, implementing, and maintaining software solutions. Software engineering ensures reliability, efficiency, and scalability in the technology industry, which depends on good software solutions for business operations, communication, and innovation.

2. Key Milestones in Software Engineering

- 1968 NATO Conference – Came up with the term "software engineering" to address the software crisis.
  - Agile Manifesto (2001) – Revolutionized development by using iterative, changeable processes.
  - Cloud Computing (2000s-Present) – Offered scalable, on-demand software offerings.

3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

- Planning – Define project scope and feasibility.
  - Analysis – Collect and document requirements.
  - Design – Develop system architecture.
  - Implementation – Implement the software itself.
  - Testing – Discover and fix bugs.
  - Deployment – Ship the product.
- Maintenance – Refine and improve post-launch.

4. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies

   - Waterfall: Linear approach, best suited to well-defined projects (e.g., government programs).
   - Agile: Iterative model, flexible to change (e.g., mobile app development).

5. Roles within a Software Engineering Team
   - Software Developer – Creates and handles code.

- Quality Assurance Engineer – Tests and ensures software quality.
- Project Manager – Arranges tasks and ensures project success.

6. Importance of IDEs & VCS

   - IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA) – Provide tools for effective coding.
   - VCS (e.g., Git, SVN) – Track and maintain control over code changes.

7. Common Issues & Solutions

   - Debugging Issues → Use logging and debugging tools.
   - Project Schedules → Develop effective time management skills.
   - Keeping Up with Technology → Engage in continuous learning.

8. Types of Testing & Their Importance
   - Unit Testing – Tests individual components.

- Integration Testing – Verifies modules interact.
  - System Testing – Tests the system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing – Verifies against user specifications.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Definition & Importance of Prompt Engineering
   Prompt engineering involves creating productive prompts for guiding AI responses, improving accuracy and relevance in AI-generated outputs.

2. Sample of Vague Prompt & Revision
   - Vague Prompt: "Tell me about cars."
   - Revised Prompt: "Compare the advantages and disadvantages of electric and gasoline cars."

- Why? The more descriptive prompt is detailed-specific, and therefore, the more focused and useful response.
